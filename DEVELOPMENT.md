# Development

## Setup Environment

In order to develop CLPy, you need to have a Python installed on your system,
either using a system-wide Python installation or a virtual environment.

If CLPy complains about missing Python libraries, you need to add the path to
the Python library to the variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
