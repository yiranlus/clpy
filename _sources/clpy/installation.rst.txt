Installation
============

Currently, the package is not available on Quicklisp. But you can still clone
it to local-project directory of Quicklisp.

If you are using `Roswell`_, you can install it using

.. code:: bash

   ros install yiranlus/clpy

After that, you can simply use CLPy with ``(ql:quickload :clpy)``.
