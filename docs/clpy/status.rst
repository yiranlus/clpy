What's Is There?
================

Currently, the following functions are available in CLPy:

* High-level PyObject Protocol
* PyNumber Operators
* Module Import
* Low-level list, dict, tuple, set methods
* Low-level sequence, mapping methods
* Smartly create PyObjects from Lisp values
* Compile and Eval functions

Some functions are more complicated:

* C module definition (probably not suitable for Common Lisp)
* Type definition

The following Common Lisp implementations are supported:

* SBCL (tested with 2.5.7)

And the supported Python versions:

* Python 3.11

I haven't test it on other platforms, so you should not use it in production.
The project is at early development, and I develop it as an personal project.
The interface can be changed at anytime.
