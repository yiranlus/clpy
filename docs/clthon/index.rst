=====================
 The CLthon Language
=====================

.. cl:package:: clthon

CLthon is a custom language built on top of :doc:`ClPy <index>`.

CLthon defined a series of macros that allow you mixing the code with Python
variables and Common Lisp code. It defines a set of global variables to take
care of the object creations and destructions and make your code free from the
tedious increasing and decreasing the reference count in Python C API.
